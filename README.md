# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hyl, My passion lies in building robust distributed systems and diving deep into the world of databases.In order to lay a solid foundation in the early stage, I carefully studied CMU15-445 and MIT6.824, and completed the corresponding experiments independently and seriously. Next, I will work hard to get closer to the industry.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** C++, Go, Python
- **Areas of Interest:** Distributed Systems, Databases, Storage
- **Tools & Frameworks:** Git, Docker.

## ðŸš€ Projects
I am currently doing:
- [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb):LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values.
- In order to make better use of the capabilities of modern high-speed network cards in a storage-computing separation database based on Aurora, I used a DPDK-based network acceleration service to transform the communication process between nodes, thereby further improving database performance.
