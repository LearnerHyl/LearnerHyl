# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hyl, My passion lies in building robust distributed systems and diving deep into the world of databases.In order to lay a solid foundation in the early stage, I carefully studied CMU15-445 and MIT6.824, and completed the corresponding experiments independently and seriously. Next, I will work hard to get closer to the industry.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** C++, Go, Python
- **Areas of Interest:** Distributed Systems, Databases, Storage
- **Tools & Frameworks:** Git, Docker.

## ðŸš€ Projects
I am currently doing:
- [Design of network communication architecture for storage and computing separation database based on DPDK]. We used the open source DPDK full user-mode suite [F-stack](https://github.com/F-Stack/f-stack). After having a preliminary understanding of its usage, we applied it to our storage-computing separation database and comprehensively transformed the communication methods of the three nodes in the hope of achieving certain performance improvements.
